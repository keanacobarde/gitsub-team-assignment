## About the User 
- The ideal user for this application is a developer
- They need a place to organize and store code and projects
- The problem this app solves for the user is it allows a place to store, organize and collaborate with code.

## Features

- Overview page: this page has an area for pinned repositories and a form to pin them
- Repository page: this page has a form for creating repos and then a container for rendering created repos
- Projects page: this page has a form for creating projects and a container for rendering created repos
- Packages page: this page has a form for creating packages and a container for rendering created packages

- Each page has a profile rendered on the side, a Nav bar that allows navigation between pages, and a footer.
